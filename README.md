# Yamaha-CL-Pong
Totally useless, but create a ping-pong animation with the ON buttons of a Yamaha CL audio mixer

It was a try based on the scripts provided by Yamaha. I had just adapted it, some parts of the code are probably useless here.

**How to use it ?**
Just write the IP adress and the port of your mixer, and it should be good.
